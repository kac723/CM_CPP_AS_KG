Task was to develop software which will solve first order wave equation using numerical methods like explicit and implict schemes.
Step to do in Computational Method:
1) Correct analytical solution
2) Test  explicit Upwind schemes and lax schemes and compare with analytical
2.5) Implement norms + test
3) Implement algorithm to solve linear sytem of equation (Thomas algorithm)
4) Implicit upwind schemes
5) Test and compare with analytical solution
6) Implicit FTCS scheme
7) Test and compare with analytical solution

Step to do in C++:
1) Create Class
2) Add exceptions handling
3) Add printing methods
4) Add more comments to code
5) Improve Matrix class
6) clean up #include in all files
